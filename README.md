# Some example detectors:
simple:
Simplest setup - a box with a half pipe hole at the center, active volume, all parameters hardcoded.
parameter:
Same detector but position, size and material are set by parameters which can be changed in the macro. Default is passive volume (no hits saved)
color:
Same multiple detectors with choice of color
